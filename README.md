# NetPhys: The Network Physician

NetPhys is a simple Python app designed to do some basic network diagnostics.

Planned features are:

* Speed tests
* Round trip (ping) tests
* IPv4 vs. IPv6 latency tests

I'm hoping to design it in a modular manner in order to make it easy for others
to build NetPhys modules for their needs.
